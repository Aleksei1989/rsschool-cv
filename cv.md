3. **Summary** I'm intersted in some kind of intllectual work, some work that helps to train my brain  in non-stop form, some work that is full of solving non-typical tasks and etc. This work is always different and helps to learn constantly. That is what I'm intersted in - always get knew knowledge. I like to look for unusual solutions, of easier and faster ways of solving tasks. My previous experience of programming in some dead languages (like Basic, Pascal, Fortran) gave me the knowledge of main principals of programming and programs structures. And also my own qualities - like perseverance, hardworking, smart - will help me to learn fast as it happened many times before. At any work my main task is that work should be done at time and a customer should be satisfied. So I spend as much time in working as it is neccessary to reach this aim.
4. **Skills:** some knowledge of programming in several dead languages -  Basic, Pascal, Fortran.
5. **Code examples:** 
6. **Experience:** I've learned programming at school and at the university and I was good. That's all my experience.
7. **Education:** Power engineer, Belarusian National Technical university - 2012
8. **English:** My English was very good before - thanks to education at my school and some extra trainings, I could talk without any problem in English, but I didn't practice it for a long time so I forgot some things, some words, but I'm sure that I will recall it all when I start to use English more often.
